👦𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗲: I'm driven by data and motivated by quality

The quote by Tukey that you've read above greatly reflects my approach to data science. If we spend 80% of our time processing data, then our focus should be on understanding the data and asking the right questions. My 2 years of experience have taught me how to appreciate data and take a data-centric approach. I want to create solutions to common problems and make artificial intelligence accessible to everyone.

📚 <b>My core competencies include</b>:
✔ Data Science ✔ Machine Learning ✔ Deep Learning ✔ Data Analysis using Python and Spark ✔ Statistical Analysis using R ✔ Database programming using MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle ✔ Data Visualization using Tableau, Power BI, Excel ✔ Cloud Computing using AWS, GCP, Azure

💡Fun Facts:
▪️ I am preparing for AWS Solutions Architect certification ▪️ In my free time, I would watch Scifi shows on Netflix or play 🎮PS4 or play 🎾Tennis ▪️ Did you know GPT-3 can build websites?!!

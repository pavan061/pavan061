<h4>
👦𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗲: I'm driven by data and motivated by quality
 The quote by Tukey that you've read above greatly reflects my approach to data science. If we spend 80% of our time processing data, then our focus should be on understanding the data and asking the right questions. My 2.5 years of experience have taught me how to appreciate data and take a data-centric approach. I want to create solutions to common problems and make artificial intelligence accessible to everyone.
